# FastFood

**FastFood** is an explorative experiment into web tecnologies for interactivity, the game is based in _javascript_ and
do not include any library or framework. The game also implies a code hierarchy and organization keeping the abstraction
for more escalability, OOP is being implemented in the code, for more efficiency.

## August 2025 update:

This is a very endeared project I used as an exploration of web technologies, working on creating interactivity and
keeping it in pure javascript to become familiar with core concepts. This also helped me develop my skills for problem
solving even if this included reinventing the wheel. Is, at it's the core, a learning and fun experiment reflecting the
excitement and curiosity of my early days.

I'm now taking the mission of continue development of this project under the same spirit of fun and curiosity, including
implementing my own version of topics, just as a way of expanding my perspective on problem-solving out of the
conventional frameworks and libraries mindset.

It shouldn't be taken as a reflection of best practices or modern standards (although I'm planning to bring a lot of that
slowly into the codebase too) as this wouldn't reflect any approach I would take in a real world production project.
